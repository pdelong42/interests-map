Interests Map
=============

This is a place for me to keep track of my interests, because I have a lot of
them, and I'm easily distracted.

I may put this in a mental map.  I had something like this in Freemind, many
years ago.  I should find that and import it into this repo.

Here's a rough first-stab at drafting an interests list (in no particular
order):

 - holography, and optics in-general

   (write me)

 - physics (outline below, write more later):

   - relativity: SR, GR, etc.
   - quantum mechanics: QFT, QED, QCD, entanglement, wave function collapse
   - quantum computing
   - lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanics
   - symmetry breaking

 - mathematics (outline below, write more later):

   - group theory
   - topology
   - calculus of variations
   - graph theory
   - complexity theory (this is more CS, but it's still math, IMHO)

 - raytracing, and computer graphics in-general

   Not only have I found computer graphics interesting for about as long as I
   can remember (it's one of the reasons I got into computers in the first
   place); but I've also found the math behind it interesting, as well as any
   special-purpose hardware that goes into it.

   One of my first full-time jobs was as the systems administrator of a bunch
   of SGI IRIX workstations, as well as the applications running on them.  And
   I was right there when the first 3D accelerated graphics cards started to
   become available for the mainstream PC market.

 - cryptography

   (write me)

 - audio and video codecs

   (write me)

 - GPGPU - general-purpose graphics processing units

   In light of the previous item, you can imagine how excited I got when that
   hardware started to find applications outside of computer graphics.  Most of
   the ideas behind that technology got their start in the niche HPC mainframe
   market (e.g., Cray, Connection Machines, etc.).  So modern 3D graphics tech is
   just an outgrowth and a trickle-down of that tech into the mainstream (with
   a healthy dose of Moore's law heaped on).

   The emergence of using that hardware for computations outside of computer
   graphics brought that theme full-circle (what's old is new again).
   Interfaces like CUDA and OpenCL are things I've been wanting to learn for
   quite a while now, but haven't had the time or bandwidth to give (hopefully
   I can change that).

 - GNU Radio and other SDR (software-defined radio)

   Another one of those intersections of "math" and "hardware".  And yes, while
   it's *software*-defined radio, it still has a large hardware component doing
   the heavy-lifting (usually in the form of DSP daughter-boards).

   ToDo: I should flesh-out this description and actually say something about,
   y'know, radio.  But I was inspired to write something, so I wrote, before I
   forgot.

 - parallel and concurrent computation (mostly pertaining to number-crunching)

   (write me)

 - anything to do with packet capture

   One specific project I had in mind is something that puts a NIC in
   promiscuous mode, listens for file requests over HTTP, and dumps the complete
   files to disk.  It's quite possible there's a fully-formed project on github
   that already does this, and I just have to find it.

   However, even if there are projects out there which do things that I already
   want, I still want to write code for these kinds of applications (or modify
   existing code), as a learning exercise.

   I also love the opportunity to play with dedicated hardware in this space
   (i.e., "packet-capture appliances").

 - Lisp, Scheme, and their various descendants

   Ever since my first exposure to Lisp (Emacs Lisp), I've caught the bug and
   haven't been able to shake it.  It just makes sense to me, I can't explain
   why.  My latest foray into this world has been learning and using Clojure.

   One side-effect of this is that it's made me want to learn more about
   compiler design, and about code translation in-general.  So yeah, I really
   should pick-up that dragon book sometime.

 - queueing theory

   I first became interested in queueing theory when the Linux O(1) scheduler
   was shiny and new.  Around that time, message queueing middleweare also
   started gaining traction, which also fueled my interest.  In the end, I
   didn't do too much with either of these applications, but I'm still
   interested in queueing theory as it applies to things like network traffic,
   actual traffic, and resource utilization as a whole.

   I've picked-up Leonard Kleinrock's book, only to put it down again because
   it required more probability background than I had.  I don't seem to have
   learned probability properly the first time around, so I'm relearning it
   now.  (Fourier Analysis is also required, but I'm pretty well-versed in that
   already.)

 - OpenGL / WebGL / WebCL

   (write me)

 - virtualization

   (write me)

 - electronics (a.k.a., actually utilizing my EE degree)

   (write me)

 - more to come...

As you can see, this list is mostly on the technical side, but isn't limited to
computery things.  Here are some things that don't really fit into the general
theme, but which I still consider interests:

 - ballroom dancing

   I haven't had time to put any energy into this hobby in quite a number of
   years (not since I worked at Rutgers)

 - music

   Yes, this is horribly non-specific.  However, my taste in music is also
   maddeningly non-specific.

   I used to be into genres, like prog-rock and ambient, but I get bored easily
   and I can't find any set of categories that helps describe my tastes (I
   generally go with "what sounds good", which isn't helpful).

 - art

   Again, not terribly descriptive.  Maybe I'll list sub-generes here as I
   think of them.

 - languages (the spoken/written kind)

   I've studied Japanese in my spare time "for fun", and I'm probably as
   skilled in it as your average first-grader in Japan (that's probably being a
   tad generous).

   I also took five years of Spanish (one year in junior high, and all four
   years of high-school).  I can't speak it fluently, and I can only understand
   every tenth word I hear conversationally.

   On the whole, I'd say I'm equally good at both languages (for better or for
   worse).
