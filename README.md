Interests Map
=============

This is a place for me to keep track of my interests, because I have a lot of
them, and I'm easily distracted.

I may put this in a mental map.  I had something like this in Freemind, many
years ago.  I should find that and import it into this repo.

Here's a rough first-stab at drafting an interests list (in no particular
order):

 - holography, and optics in-general

   (write me)

 - raytracing, and computer graphics in-general

   Not only have I found computer graphics interesting for about as long as I
   can remember (it's one of the reasons I got into computers in the first
   place); but I've also found the math behind it interesting, as well as any
   special-purpose hardware that goes into it.

   One of my first full-time jobs was as the systems administrator of a bunch
   of SGI IRIX workstations, as well as the applications running on them.  And
   I was right there when the first 3D accelerated graphics cards started to
   become available for the mainstream PC market.

 - GPGPU - general-purpose graphics processing units

   In light of the previous item, you can imagine how excited I got when that
   hardware started to find applications outside of computer graphics.  Most of
   the ideas behind that technology got their start in the niche HPC mainframe
   market (e.g., Cray, Connection Machines, etc.).  So modern 3D graphics tech is
   just an outgrowth and a trickle-down of that tech into the mainstream (with
   a healthy dose of Moore's law heaped on).

   The emergence of using that hardware for computations outside of computer
   graphics brought that theme full-circle (what's old is new again).
   Interfaces like CUDA and OpenCL are things I've been wanting to learn for
   quite a while now, but haven't had the time or bandwidth to give (hopefully
   I can change that).

 - GNU Radio and other SDR (software-defined radio)

   Another one of those intersections of "math" and "hardware".  And yes, while
   it's *software*-defined radio, it still has a large hardware component doing
   the heavy-lifting (usually in the form of DSP daughter-boards).

   ToDo: I should flesh-out this description and actually say something about,
   y'know, radio.  But I was inspired to write something, so I wrote, before I
   forgot.

 - parallel and concurrent computation (mostly pertaining to number-crunching)

   (write me)

 - anything to do with packet capture

   One specific project I had in mind is something that puts a NIC in
   promiscuous mode, listens for file requests over HTTP, and dumps the complete
   files to disk.  It's quite possible there's a fully-formed project on github
   that already does this, and I just have to find it.

   However, even if there are projects out there which do things that I already
   want, I still want to write code for these kinds of applications (or modify
   existing code), as a learning exercise.

   I also love the opportunity to play with dedicated hardware in this space
   (i.e., "packet-capture appliances").

 - virtualization

 - more to come...

As you can see, it's mostly on the technical side, but isn't limited to
computery things.  I'm debating whether to be daring and step outside that box,
by including things like ballroom dancing (which I haven't had time to put any
energy into in a number of years) and the types of art and music I find
interesting (which I really haven't even fully articulated yet, even to
myself).  Music is especially hard to pin-down: I used to be into genres, like
prog-rock and ambient, but I get bored easily and I can't find any set of
categories that helps describe my tastes (I generally go with "what sounds
good", which isn't helpful).
