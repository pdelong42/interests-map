Interests Map
=============

This is a place for me to keep track of my interests, because I have a lot of
them, and I'm easily distracted.

I may put this in a mental map.  I had something like this in Freemind, many
years ago.  I should find that and import it into this repo.

Here's a rough first-stab at drafting an interests list (in no particular
order):

 - anything to do with packet capture

   One specific project I had in mind is something that puts a NIC in
   promiscuous mode, listens for file requests over HTTP, and dumps the complete
   files to disk.  It's quite possible there's a fully-formed project on github
   that already does this, and I just have to find it.

   However, even if there are projects out there which do things that I already
   want, I still want to write code for these kinds of applications (or modify
   existing code), as a learning exercise.

   I also love the opportunity to play with dedicated hardware in this space
   (i.e., "packet-capture appliances").

 - raytracing, and computer graphics in-general

   Not only have I found computer graphics interesting for about as long as I
   can remember (it's one of the reasons I got into computers in the first
   place); but I've also found the math behind it interesting, as well as any
   special-purpose hardware that goes into it.

   One of my first full-time jobs was as the systems administrator of a bunch
   of SGI IRIX workstations, as well as the applications running on them.  And
   I was right there when the first 3D accelerated graphics cards started to
   become available for the mainstream PC market.

 - GPGPU - general-purpose graphics processing units

   In light of the previous item, you can imagine how excited I got when that
   hardware started to find applications outside of computer graphics.  Most of
   the ideas behind that technology got its start in the niche HPC mainfraime
   market (e.g., Cray, Conneciton Machines, etc.).  So modern 3D graphics cards
   were just an outgrowth and a trickle-down of that tech into the mainstream.

   The emergence of using that hardware for computations outside of computer
   graphics brought that theme full-circle (what's old is new again).
   Interfaces like CUDA and OpenCL are things I've been wanting to learn for
   quite a while now, but haven't had the time or bandwidth to give (hopefully
   I can change that).

 - GNU Radio and other SDR (software-defined radio)

 - holography, and optics in-general

 - virtualization

 - more to come...

As you can see, it's mostly on the technical side, but isn't limited to
computery things.  I'm debating whether to be daring and step outside that box,
by including things like ballroom dancing (which I haven't had time to put any
energy into in a number of years) and the types of art I find interesting
(which I really haven't even fully articulated yet, even to myself).
