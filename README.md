Interests Map
=============

This is a place for me to keep track of my interests, because I have a lot of
them, and I'm easily distracted.

I may put this in a mental map.  I had something like this in Freemind, many
years ago.  I should find that and import it into this repo.

Here's a rough first-stab at drafting an interests list:

 - anything to do with packet capture

   - one specific project I had in mind is something that puts a NIC in
     promiscuous mode, listens for file requests over HTTP, and dumps the
     complete files to disk (it's quite possible there's a fully-formed project
     on github that already does this, and I just have to find it)

 - GPGPU

   - write some descriptive stuff here

 - GNU Radio and other SDR (software-defined radio)

 - holography

 - optics in-general

 - more to come...

As you can see, it's mostly on the technical side, but isn't limited to
computery things.
